## Introduction

This project aims to two interralated goals. It is first a training project to put basic frontend technologies to develop a simple portfolio page.
Secondly, it aims to showcase these skills to job recruiters who might want to get to know me and my skills a little better, since I yet do not have
any professional experience in the industry.

The project serves these two purposes in a simple manne, in a single page that displays relevant information about me and my skills as a frontend developer.

## Technologies

This project was created with:

* HTML5
* CSS
* Javascript

I also used Aseprite to make basic graphic assets to design the page and Figma to wireframe it.

## About me

I am a frontend developer aspiring to land my first job experience in the industry. I am a professional highschool teacher who taught himself how to code from an
early age. I have always drawn to webapp development and for that I learned the basic standard technologies and focus on mastering Javascript and Python for frontend
and backend development, respectively.

You can reach me through my email: iribastrillo@gmail.com.
